# Using TwilioQuest Tilesets: Style Guide

The `twilioquest-base` extension provides a large variety of tileable art assets that can be used to build new maps within TwilioQuest. The majority of 
these art assets are mapped to a grid-based layout in `TwilioQuestTileset.png`. 

If this is your first time encountering TwilioQuest tilesets, the number of assets you can use can be a little overwhelming! This guide will help you not 
only identify important tiles, but also how to use them to match the quality of level design found in TwilioQuest.

## Repeatable tiles

Some tiles in `TwilioQuestTileset.png` can be placed next to themselves to create a pattern. These repeatable patterns assist in breaking up the grid-like 
appearance of the tiles. Below is a common example of a layout of tiles in the tileset that can repeat. This layout is made up of 4 different types of 
tiles.
