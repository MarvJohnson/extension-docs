## Entirely Uninstall TwilioQuest

1. Delete the Launcher application from your computer
2. Find the User Data directory as instructed below
3. Delete the entire `TwilioQuest` folder in your User Data directory

## Where is the User Data Directory?

TwilioQuest stores data in the default "User Data" location on each operating system. This folder is called `TwilioQuest`. In TwilioQuest `3.5+` you can use the `Help > Open User Data` option to open the user data directory.

In older versions of TwilioQuest, or to find the directory without opening the game, these are the locations to check:

- on Linux: `~/.config/TwilioQuest`
- on macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/TwilioQuest`
  - Library is a hidden folder on MacOS. If you cannot see the folder in Finder, try using the hotkey `cmd+shift+.` to show hidden files.
- on Windows: `C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\TwilioQuest`
